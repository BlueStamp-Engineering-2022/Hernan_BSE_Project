# Smart Mirror
With a Raspberry Pi and a few other components, the Smart Mirror is a customizable mirror that projects a computer display over a traditional reflective mirror. Some possible uses include displaying the time, a calendar, picture, or other applications in your reflection. You will be transported to a sci-fi world in the comfort of your home!

# Final Milestone

My third milestone is the completed product of the SmartMirror. I customized the display to the SmartMirror. I removed the code for the monitor to display the compliments on the bottom (as shown in the first milestone video) because they took up a large amount of space that I wanted to dedicate to other modules. Namely, I added a Spotify module to display what song is playing on my Spotify account by linking my Spotify account to a Client ID that is unique to my device (and any device I want to add in the future) using the "Spotify for Developers” website. Using this Client ID and the “Client Secret” labeled on the website, I was able to write code for the module that allows my Spotify account to be linked to my SmartMirror display. I also added a “Daily Pokemon” module, which showcases a random pokemon in the bottom right of the display and refreshes, whether when the mirror is restarted or every 24 hours. Moreover, I managed to get the weather module to work. I ran into many problems while trying to get it to display the location of my choice. I solved this by using OpenWeatherMap to find the latitude and longitude of my location. I then used OpenWeatherMap again to get an API that I can copy into my code, and finally, I added a line of code that would make the weather units display using the Imperial system. Finally, I used Unsplash Developers to, again, obtain an API that I can use to put into my code that would allow me to link my SmartMirror to the Unsplash website to get images to display on my SmartMirror. However, this was a problem because the image may block out the reflection being shown, so I added code that would make the image being displayed more opaque, thus, the other modules and my reflection would be more clear. Moreover, I also applied wood stain onto the inner frame of the mirror, as well as built an outer frame which was painted in black. To make the outer frame, I used spare “1x3” wood I had from when I made my first frame for the inside of the mirror with miter joints. This was a lengthy process, however, because I mismeaured the lengths of wood two times and had to continuously shave off more wood on my boards, as well as redesign how my outer frame would look on the mirror itself. There was trouble with my 45o angle markings as well. I learned the hard way that importance of measuring properly and accurately. I used rulers and protractors in order to rework my ideas and succeed.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone was building the frame of the monitor. On my first attempt at building the frame, I used a ruler and handsaw to measure and cut pieces of wood that would be able to hold the monitor. The wood used was a "1x3" plank of wood. Two were measured at 24 inches long and the other two sides were measured to be 14 inches long. I then used wood glue to put the joints together with the two longer sides sitting on the inside edges of the two shorter sides. This design, however, I ultimately scrapped due to the wood pieces not being cut completely straight, and the final frame being warped/not flat (Image - Top Left). To solve this, I used a different design, as well as used drills and screws to assemble to frame (Top Right). I also used "1x4" wood which gave a greater width to my frame to hold the monitor more nicely. The new design also requires this, as I planned to use the hinge on the back of the monitor to attach the monitor to the frame itself. Again, I cut the wood using a hand saw and make drill holes in the wood at the joints while clamping down the wood to a surface. I added the screws and the frame was finished being assembled. Then, I cut another piece of wood that would hold the monitor in place when in the frame. By cutting the board roughly the same length as the monitor, I was able to wedge the board tightly into the frame without the use of screws (Bottom Right).

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone involved installing the "MagicMirror" onto my monitor with the use of Raspberry Pi. First, I downloaded Raspberry Pi and used a microSD card to store and transfer data. Hooking the Raspberry Pi onto the monitor with the use of HDMI allowed me to write the code necessary on the Raspberry Pi to download Node.js onto the Raspberry Pi itself, which is a programming environment on the Pi. Using this, I wrote a series of codes that installed "MagicMirror" to Pi and to be displayed on the monitor which will be used to customize the display shown in the final product. I did have some challenges while writing the code. Namely, I had trouble with writing the code properly, as well as unexpected display errors with the Pi onto the monitor. Overall, I learned how to navigate and use Raspberry Pi to explore programming languages to complete a given task.

# Starter Project

My starter project was assembling and soldering all the necessary components onto my circuit borad for my "TV-B Gone" project. The resonator, electrolytic capacitor, transistors, infared LEDs, and resistores, to ensure that my TV-B Gone functions properly. Due to the relative simplicity of the project, it was simple to assemble, however it was fun to research and learn about the different components of the TV-B Gone and how it relates to the functioning of a television. I leanred how the resonator acts as a timing clock that keeps the chip on time and generate precise waveforms. Electrolytic capacitors generally, this device uses electrolyte, which is a liquid gel with a high concentration of ions, to increase the capacitance, which allows for greater energy-storing and collecting. In televisions, infrared is used to send signals from the remote (the transmitter), and the TV itself (the receiver). The LEDs act as a transmitter. The LEDs emit an infrared signal in a special sequence of 0’s and 1’s, binary,  to tell the television to “shut off”. This strater project served as an introduction to soldering as well as a way to grow my researching capabilities
