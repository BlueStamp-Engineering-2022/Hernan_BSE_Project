# Smart Mirror
With a Raspberry Pi and a few other components, the Smart Mirror is a customizable mirror that projects a computer display over a traditional reflective mirror. Some possible uses include displaying the time, a calendar, picture, or other applications in your reflection. You will be transported to a sci-fi world in the comfort of your home!

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone was building the frame of the monitor. On my first attempt at building the frame, I used a ruler and handsaw to measure and cut pieces of wood that would be able to hold the monitor. The wood used was a "1x3" plank of wood. Two were measured at 24 inches long and the other two sides were measured to be 14 inches long. I then used wood glue to put the joints together with the two longer sides sitting on the inside edges of the two shorter sides. This design, however, I ultimately scrapped due to the wood pieces not being cut completely straight, and the final frame being warped/not flat. To solve this, I used a different design, as well as used drills and screws to assemble to frame. I also used "1x4" wood which gave a greater width to my frame to hold the monitor more nicely. The new design also requires this, as I planned to use the hinge on the back of the monitor to attach the monitor to the frame itself. Again, I cut the wood using a hand saw and make drill holes in the wood at the joints while clamping down the wood to a surface. I added the screws and the frame was finished being assembled. Then, I cut another piece of wood that would hold the monitor in place when in the frame. By cutting the board roughly the same length as the monitor, I was able to wedge the board tightly in the frame without the use of screws.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone involved installing the "MagicMirror" onto my monitor with the use of Raspberry Pi. First, I downloaded Raspberry Pi and used a microSD card to store and transfer data. Hooking the Raspberry Pi onto the monitor with the use of HDMI allowed me to write the code necessary on the Raspberry Pi to download Node.js onto the Raspberry Pi itself, which is a programming environment on the Pi. Using this, I wrote a series of codes that installed "MagicMirror" to Pi and to be displayed on the monitor which will be used to customize the display shown in the final product. I did have some challenges while writing the code. Namely, I had trouble with writing the code properly, as well as unexpected display errors with the Pi onto the monitor. Overall, I learned how to navigate and use Raspberry Pi to explore programming languages to complete a given task.

# Starter Project

My starter project was assembling and soldering all the necessary components onto my circuit borad for my "TV-B Gone" project. The resonator, electrolytic capacitor, transistors, infared LEDs, and resistores, to ensure that my TV-B Gone functions properly. Due to the relative simplicity of the project, it was simple to assemble, however it was fun to research and learn about the different components of the TV-B Gone and how it relates to the functioning of a television. I leanred how the resonator acts as a timing clock that keeps the chip on time and generate precise waveforms. Electrolytic capacitors generally, this device uses electrolyte, which is a liquid gel with a high concentration of ions, to increase the capacitance, which allows for greater energy-storing and collecting. In televisions, infrared is used to send signals from the remote (the transmitter), and the TV itself (the receiver). The LEDs act as a transmitter. The LEDs emit an infrared signal in a special sequence of 0’s and 1’s, binary,  to tell the television to “shut off”. This strater project served as an introduction to soldering as well as a way to grow my researching capabilities
